#### Who is the key user?

#### What is that user's number one critical goal when using the site? Be as specific as possible if there are multiple options here, e.g. "to purchase a red wagon" instead of "buy a toy".

#### What is likely to make that user's experience particularly positive (i.e. provide good satisfaction)?

##### What is the approximate information architecture of the site? (sketch it out)

#### What is the flow through that architecture for the user who is accomplishing the critical goal you identified above?

#### What style(s) of navigation is/are used? Do they answer the key questions (Where am I and how did I get here? Where should I go next and how do I get there?)?

#### What key interactions does the user have? Are they clear and usable?

#### What did the site do well to allow the user to accomplish his goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction?

#### What did the site do poorly when allowing the user to accomplish his goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction?
