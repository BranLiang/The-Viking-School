## Website teardown for website Twitter.com, AirBnB.com and Amazon.com

### Twitter.com

#### Who is the key user? This isn't always clear, especially in marketplace sites, so take your best guess.
Young people who is social. The people is well-known in a specific area and would like to be engaged with their fans or interested people. People who would like to be kept updated in some specific topics. People who always want to get the new ASAP. --> These are possible key users. In conclusion, the key user would be people who like to be connected and like fast information. And mostly are young people.  
#### What is that user's number one critical goal when using the site? Be as specific as possible if there are multiple options here, e.g. "to purchase a red wagon" instead of "buy a toy".
The number one goal for a user who is seeking information through the Twitter is to find the interested information as precise as possible. More specifically, the goal is to find the correct people or group to follow and interact with.
#### What is likely to make that user's experience particularly positive (i.e. provide good satisfaction)?
User can see the information directly without searching and navigating elsewhere. Not too much confusing information around.
##### What is the approximate information architecture of the site? (sketch it out)
message list board --> { detail message information | user's personal information. |  personal message board | friends list | followers list }
#### What is the flow through that architecture for the user who is accomplishing the critical goal you identified above?
Directly from the user's message board to the other architectures.
#### What style(s) of navigation is/are used? Do they answer the key questions (Where am I and how did I get here? Where should I go next and how do I get there?)?
The twitter architecture style is kind of message board style. I can  easily find the newest tweet I am looking for and they are also offering the trends for us which is a really nice feature. As is really clear that I can figure out that I am at the index page. And there is a huge message board listed there. However, the search field is kind small that I sometime just could not find it out. As I am digging in more deeply, I can also figure out Where am I. However, as for the navigation bar at the very front. I sometime will just could not see them as they are so likely to be ignored. Therefore, it will make me hard to find the home button and the other message button.
#### What key interactions does the user have? Are they clear and usable?
Following topics, users, companies. It's clear and usable. Although there is no such specific navigation system for you to search through in order to find the proper topic. You can still find related stuff through its kind of intelligent search engine. And I really enjoy that.
#### What did the site do well to allow the user to accomplish his goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction?
Very quick refresh and notification system. Precise people recommendations according to my search history. However, I have not used twitter a lot yet. I can say too much for the twitting system yet.
#### What did the site do poorly when allowing the user to accomplish his goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction?
The like and save function does not seem to be doing, as I just couldn't find the post save button. I am kind of thinking that maybe according to the like button that I can save the post some where as I like it a lot. However, the result is frustrating as I still could not find my beloved post anywhere. Therefore, this feature is kind of annoying to me. As the only way for me to save the post is by retweeting it again.






### AirBnB.com

#### Who is the key user? This isn't always clear, especially in marketplace sites, so take your best guess.
Key user -- definitely there is no doubt that is young traveler who likes experiencing new things and meets new friends around the world.
#### What is that user's number one critical goal when using the site? Be as specific as possible if there are multiple options here, e.g. "to purchase a red wagon" instead of "buy a toy".
Unlike the traditional hotel booking Website. Through this AirBnB people here wants to find out the nicest house with friendly people to spend their holiday time.
#### What is likely to make that user's experience particularly positive (i.e. provide good satisfaction)?
Clear searching system. Smart filtering which can help find the proper room for the user. Also, the review system is also very important as this will normally drive the user's decision in the end. Easy payment method is also very important.
##### What is the approximate information architecture of the site? (sketch it out)
AirBnB is kind of the daisy type of the information architecture. users will always return to the front page after finishing the booking process.
#### What is the flow through that architecture for the user who is accomplishing the critical goal you identified above?
Landing at the front-page --> Search for a destination and the date information --> Looking through the possible results along with its general information (overall picture and the location information) --> to the rooms specifically interested. --> to the purchase page --> finish the purchase and review the purchase --> to the home page and find more stories there.
#### What style(s) of navigation is/are used? Do they answer the key questions (Where am I and how did I get here? Where should I go next and how do I get there?)?
AirBnB is kind of like one page navigation style with many picture cards on it. The main navigation bar lies at the top the website, which is always accompanies with a short title to tell you where you are now. However, it can be hard for people to go to the home page as there is no clear button to show that at the top navbar. The only way to do it I find now is clicking the 'not so obvious' AirBnB logo button. But I don't think all people will find it out. if not then they are stuck there. Also after going through the tour-tips page, the user may want to decide to book a room now. However it would be strange that he/she can hardly find a place to make that booking. One thing also make the experience bad is that you seems can not change the website language as you wish. This would be really annoying for many users from my point of view as many of them are doing going abroad traveling and their language are different to their destination's language, however they can only use the language arranged by the AirBnB. What if they don't understand?
#### What key interactions does the user have? Are they clear and usable?
Key interactions are searching the available room and filtering the results and then finish the booking. During the period of the room comparing, one thing not clear to me is the price tag. As I searched for a room in Nanjing, and I am using an ip addresses in Hongkong. The price tag shows a dollar sign along with a HK money sign which is really confusing to me at first, and also I don't know if the price is for one night or for the total booking period. And this makes me thinking which is bad for a website.
#### What did the site do well to allow the user to accomplish his goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction?
It shows a short background video behind the searching bar to show the good experience of the using of the AirBnB. During the searching  process, the result is really smart as I just need to type a few words and the desired results will be shown in the drop down list. One of the best thing is that it shows the most popular and best reviewed rooms to you immediately after searching. You don't need to make that filtering and comparison your self.
#### What did the site do poorly when allowing the user to accomplish his goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction?
However the video does't works for me at lease. It is kind of slow and short, I was expecting it to be a little big longer. I think the video can be made much better in the future. Also in terms of the large photo at the home page which is used to show the user some guides and place recommendations. The looking style is kind of boring, also the same picture, no animation also. And one thing would also be awesome is that if AirBnB to change the searching background dynamically according to the user searching result. Like show the nice picture of London when London is search by the user.

### Amazon.com

#### Who is the key user? This isn't always clear, especially in marketplace sites, so take your best guess.
Shopper. Very clear user.
#### What is that user's number one critical goal when using the site? Be as specific as possible if there are multiple options here, e.g. "to purchase a red wagon" instead of "buy a toy".
Number one goal is definitely to find the desired product as soon as possible.
#### What is likely to make that user's experience particularly positive (i.e. provide good satisfaction)?
Very nice and clean website without too much flashing advertisements. Smart navigation system that can help you find the product you want as soon as possible. Very fast purchase process. Good product descriptions that can let the user to know more about the product.
##### What is the approximate information architecture of the site? (sketch it out)
The information architecture of the site is kind of like multidimensional hierarchy. Information architecture in Amazon is really big. Millions sellers with their products resulted in Millions of web-pages. But basically it looks like from a center page to product page according to the searching process.
#### What is the flow through that architecture for the user who is accomplishing the critical goal you identified above?
User google a product and find the product link on Amazon and go to the product link directly. (Assuming I am about to buy a ps4 console.) So after I googled the ps4. I found the amazon link at the very front, very nice feature. Great! Then I just clicked the link. In the amazon page, I was shown by several categories which asks me if I want to but a ps4 console? or a ps4 game or just ps4 accessories. Also below the category list, there is another bar shows the best seller with their product (two gift cards and one dragon ball game). After several category like that mentioned above, I finally find the searching results, and there are several consoles listed there, great. Now I picked one which is Uncharteded 4 limited edition bundle. It shows the prices tag and shipping policies. Look through the product descriptions and then I click the add to cart then I need to click the proceed to checkout.

User go the home page and search the ps4 at the amazon search field. It shows a different result compared with the one comes from the google.
It shows the play station store as well as the result list. The following is the same.

#### What style(s) of navigation is/are used? Do they answer the key questions (Where am I and how did I get here? Where should I go next and how do I get there?)?
The navigation style is structured category system. The navigation menu lies on the left side with lots of filtering options for differnt people. There is also another navbat on the top which can let the user to search and explore different categories of products. It does let me know where I am and following the link at the top navi bar I can easily go the position where I want.
#### What key interactions does the user have? Are they clear and usable?
Navigation is the key interaction.It is quiet clear as your mouse hover on the category the sublist will automatic show up. The animation is quiet appealing. Also when I entered the category the search bar will also adapt to search only the item in this category.
#### What did the site do well to allow the user to accomplish his goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction?
A good thing is that unlike the other website. The home page of amazon is very clean and clear. The information there is not so overwhelming. Also the event or promotion is also to the point. Not too much useless promotion there. The search result is also very satisfying.
#### What did the site do poorly when allowing the user to accomplish his goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction?
The product information display is still very pool. Some of them even don't have descriptions at all. Also as the home page of the amazon is very nice. The detailed page of the product looks not so appealing as too much information just flooded in all at once. I don't think the user want all the information listed all at once. From top to the bottom, you can see the product picture, the price, the deliver policies, the brief description, the recommended products, the similar products, what other people buys, production information, production description, the question area, the custom review. Really lots of information listed there. And the overall looking is just kind of old fashioned.
