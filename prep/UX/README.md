## Website teardown for website Twitter.com, AirBnB.com and Amazon.com

### Twitter.com

#### Who is the key user? This isn't always clear, especially in marketplace sites, so take your best guess.
Young people who is social. The people is well-known in a specific area and would like to be engaged with their fans or interested people. People who would like to be kept updated in some specific topics. People who always want to get the new ASAP. --> These are possible key users. In conclusion, the key user would be people who like to be connected and like fast information. And mostly are young people.  
#### What is that user's number one critical goal when using the site? Be as specific as possible if there are multiple options here, e.g. "to purchase a red wagon" instead of "buy a toy".
The number one goal for a user who is seeking information through the Twitter is to find the interested information as precise as possible. More specifically, the goal is to find the correct people or group to follow and interact with.
#### What is likely to make that user's experience particularly positive (i.e. provide good satisfaction)?
User can see the information directly without searching and navigating elsewhere. Not too much confusing information around.
##### What is the approximate information architecture of the site? (sketch it out)
message list board --> { detail message information | user's personal information. |  personal message board | friends list | followers list }
#### What is the flow through that architecture for the user who is accomplishing the critical goal you identified above?
Directly from the user's message board to the other architectures.
#### What style(s) of navigation is/are used? Do they answer the key questions (Where am I and how did I get here? Where should I go next and how do I get there?)?
The twitter architecture style is kind of message board style. I can  easily find the newest tweet I am looking for and they are also offering the trends for us which is a really nice feature. As is really clear that I can figure out that I am at the index page. And there is a huge message board listed there. However, the search field is kind small that I sometime just could not find it out. As I am digging in more deeply, I can also figure out Where am I. However, as for the navigation bar at the very front. I sometime will just could not see them as they are so likely to be ignored. Therefore, it will make me hard to find the home button and the other message button.
#### What key interactions does the user have? Are they clear and usable?
Following topics, users, companies. It's clear and usable. Although there is no such specific navigation system for you to search through in order to find the proper topic. You can still find related stuff through its kind of intelligent search engine. And I really enjoy that.
#### What did the site do well to allow the user to accomplish his goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction?
Very quick refresh and notification system. Precise people recommendations according to my search history. However, I have not used twitter a lot yet. I can say too much for the twitting system yet.
#### What did the site do poorly when allowing the user to accomplish his goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction?
The like and save function does not seem to be doing, as I just couldn't find the post save button. I am kind of thinking that maybe according to the like button that I can save the post some where as I like it a lot. However, the result is frustrating as I still could not find my beloved post anywhere. Therefore, this feature is kind of annoying to me. As the only way for me to save the post is by retweeting it again.
