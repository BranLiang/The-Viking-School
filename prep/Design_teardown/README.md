# Design teardowns for *[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/)*, *[TMZ](http://www.tmz.com/)*, *[Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/)*

For the period of the review. The adblock is paused temporarily.

## New York Times
###Open your eyes and ask yourself "who is the user?"
People who want to read news.
###What is the user's critical goal? (or at least what do you think the site owner wants them to do?)
Read the most important news as easy as possible.  
###Does the visual hierarchy you sketched lead to that goal?
Yes, there is a big picture area which shows the news to the user. Therefore, the user can easily be gazed by this giant news block.
###What font families are most prominent on the site? (use the WhatFont add-on or your browser's developer tools to inspect this).
Navigation:      Nyt-Franklin 13-15pt
Top news topic:  Nyt-Cheltenham-Bold Italic 40px
Side news topic: Nyt-CheltenhamSh-Bold 17px
News content:    Georgia-Regular 16px
Author:          Georgia-Regular 12px

So in conclude, the most used font is Cheltenham and Georgia.
###How do these font families contribute to or take away from the site's flow?
Frankin font family looks very straight. Gives me a very clear impression. Nyt-Cheltenham-Bold looks kind of more stylish than Franklin, it draws more attention to the users as they are scrolling down the website. Georgia looks formal, compared with the title font family, it is more readable. Thus, all font-family all served there missions to the user.
###How do the line spacings, sizes, colors and weights contribute to or take away from the site's flow?
All the text there use 0px space between text letters. There is no customization for that. But the default space between the letter served well.
###What would you improve to achieve a better hierarchy or flow?
I would fix the position of the top menu bar, so after scrolling down a lot from the top, I can still go to other branches easily, rather than go the top and find the category again. It makes no sense for the section menu there left beside the search menu.




##TMZ
###Open your eyes and ask yourself "who is the user?"
People who want to see interesting staff and news.
###What is the user's critical goal? (or at least what do you think the site owner wants them to do?)
See the interesting news continuously.
###Does the visual hierarchy you sketched lead to that goal?
Not really, it confused me for a while at the very beginning as a giant ads stays there at the very top forever. You can not close it. After scrolling down, there are continuously posts with big pictures drawing my attention along with some ads also. But generally, when I am scrolling down I can always find one post follow another post.
###What font families are most prominent on the site? (use the WhatFont add-on or your browser's developer tools to inspect this).
Navigation:     Roboto Condensed  15px
Top news title: SourceSans Pro 72px
News content:   SourceSans Pro 18px

In conclusion, the dominant font family is SourceSans Pro
###How do these font families contribute to or take away from the site's flow?
The Roboto font for the navigation is just too normal and it can just easily be ignored by the user, which will confuse them a little in order to find the location of the navigation bar. The good thing is that the navigation bar will automatic stick to the top of the website as users scrolling down the page. The 72px SourceSans is just too big from my point of view. It makes me think that there must something really big happened somewhere, however, it's not. And the content in SourceSans also does not looks so good, not a feeling of profession for me.   
###How do the line spacings, sizes, colors and weights contribute to or take away from the site's flow?
No spacings for the text. Color of the title is completely black which generate a great contrast feeling to the user. The impact is kind of a little bit overwhelming. Weight for the title is also too high. And also the recommended content draws more attention too me than the normal content.   
###What would you improve to achieve a better hierarchy or flow?
Definitely modify the news title font and size, as well as the content font-family. I just don't feel like the font-family.


##Hoffington Post
###Open your eyes and ask yourself "who is the user?"
People who wants to see news with pictures more than text.
###What is the user's critical goal? (or at least what do you think the site owner wants them to do?)
Quickly find the interested news through looking through pictures rather than looking at the words.
###Does the visual hierarchy you sketched lead to that goal?
Yes, it does. There are so many pictures there.
###What font families are most prominent on the site? (use the WhatFont add-on or your browser's developer tools to inspect this).
Logo: ProximaNovaCond Extrabld  110px
Top news title:  ProximaNovaCond 30px
Trending title:  ProximaNovaCond 22px
Subtopic title:  ProximaNovaCond 20px
Main content:    NoteNashk Arabic 21px

The most dominant font-family is ProximaNovaCond and NoteNashk.
###How do these font families contribute to or take away from the site's flow?
ProximaNovaCond looks ... not bad. formal, clear and it also has strong impact for the user. Draws a lot of attention from the users. The NoteNashk is very clear and readable.
###How do the line spacings, sizes, colors and weights contribute to or take away from the site's flow?
Color is black for all the titles and light gray for the Author. For the main content, the color is not black and it looks generally smooth to the user.  
###What would you improve to achieve a better hierarchy or flow?
I would emphasis the category title a little bit more. As the color for the caterory there now in the page is kind of light and among so many dark bold titles, the category can hardly be find by the users, this will make the content in the whole page looks like they are all in the same category. user will easily get lost among so many titles.
