# Facebook teardown

##UX
###Who is the main user of Facebook?
Young people who likes social
###What are the top 3 critical goals for that user?
can make nice posts to the friends, can be updated with friends news, good interaction experience with friends.
###What is the site's approximate information architecture? (in general -- don't get caught up in the details too much)
main post board --> peoples personal post board
###For your top user goal, what is likely to make the user's experience particularly satisfying?
nice and clean message board will make me happy.
###To accomplish this goal, how does the user flow through the site's architecture? (ie. which pages are visited and what are clicked?)
if not signed in, sign in page --> main page --> peoples personal post board; if signed in, just directly go to the main page --> peoples personal post board.
###What style(s) of navigation is/are used? Do they answer the key questions (Where am I and how did I get here? Where should I go next and how do I get there?)?
The navigation bar lies on the top of the website and it is fixed there, I can always go to the home page whenever I want.
###What does Facebook do well to allow the user to accomplish the top goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction?
The post area lies at the top middle, very obvious and the cool posts just follows one by one.
###What does Facebook do poorly when allowing the user to accomplish the top goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction?
It is unfriendly to the programmer, because they can not show the code clear through the post area.
###What font families are most prominent on the page?
Helvetica
